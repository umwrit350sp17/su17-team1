# Team 1: Document Outline 

This file contains an analysis of the audience for our document and a general outline of our project. 
 
## Audience Profile
Misty Gish is a freshman at the University of Mississippi during the Fall of 2018. While in high school, Misty primarily used Microsoft PowerPoint and Keynote for her class presentations. Now that she is at the university, she no longer has her Mac for Keynote, and she cannot afford Microsoft PowerPoint. She has attempted to use Google Presentation but found it confusing and basic. Furthermore, she has not had any opportunities until now to explore an open source.
 
Misty Gish is currently in Writ 101 and has been given an assignment that requires her to use a presentation software as well as present her project to the class. She is looking for software that is simple but can function similarly to Microsoft PowerPoint or Keynote. Furthermore, she needs software that has templates, great 2D and 3D graphics, and special effects to make her presentation pop. Her teacher has informed her that she will need access to software that will allow her to open Microsoft PowerPoint presentations in order to view examples. Misty Gish is not completely confident in her public speaking skills, but Apache OpenOffice Impress allows the presenter to view notes, time, and upcoming slides while presenting.
 
Misty Gish prefers colorful visuals with short, concise bullet points. One limitation with our documentation is that we have limited knowledge of Apache OpenOffice; therefore, we will not be able to answer all of Misty’s questions or concerns. First-year students, like Misty, make-up the audience for our project because they can view our documentation to learn how to use Apache OpenOffice’s Impress as their primary presentation software. 
 
## Project Outline 
Project: Using Apache OpenOffice to Create a Presentation. 
 
### Overall Organization 
* We will create a folder in our GitHub repository specifically for the documentation of our project. The README file for that folder will contain an introduction to our document. 
 
* Along with the introduction in the README file, there will be a list that contains links to various files. Each file will contain a set of instructions for a particular task. 
 
### External Links and Screenshots 
* We are not planning on incorporating any external source information into our documentation besides a link to the Apache OpenOffice homepage (https://www.openoffice.org/) and a link to the Apache OpenOffice help site (https://www.openoffice.org/support/index.html). 
 
* We plan on incorporating at least one screenshot per instructional file to display examples of what each step should look like. 
 
### General Outline of Content 
* **Introduction** - We will introduce our document in the README file of its folder as mentioned above. We will directly address the audience by using second-person point of view. In the introduction, we will focus on the benefits of using Apache OpenOffice over proprietary source programs to create presentations for first year writing courses. We will then explain that our document can be used as a simple guide for developing such presentations.
 
* **Task Instructions** - In the same README file, we will provide individual links to each of the instructional files shown in bold below. Under certain file names, there are brief listings of potential content.   
 
 1. **How to Download and Install Apache OpenOffice** 
* Downloading software
* Installing software
 2. **How to Begin Developing a Presentation** 
* Starting presentation
* Choosing background/theme 
 3. **How to Add and Format Text** 
*	Adding text 	
* Formatting text 
 4. **How to Add and Format Multimedia Content** 
* Adding and formatting pictures
* Adding and formatting videos
 5. **How to Save a Presentation** 
* Saving to computer
* Saving to USB
 6. **How to Set-Up a Presentation to Deliver in Class**
 
 7. **Any Questions?** 
* Summary of document
* Link to help site  

-Note: The organization and topics of these files could change as the document is developed, but we plan on having at least seven files of instructions.
 
* **Conclusion**: We plan on having the file named “Any Questions?” serve as the concluding segment of our document. We will summarize what the audience should have learned from our document. We will also provide the link to the Apache OpenOffice help site so that the audience has access to tutorials and other helpful information that we are not equipped to provide.
